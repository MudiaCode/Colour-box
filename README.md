# Colour-box
This is my first front-end project where I test my skills at JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

# Lessons Learned
This project wasn't too hard for me but I did come across some small errors that caused my code to fail.
- Research: I learned which information to search for on the internet for efficient problem solving
- Styling CSS: while testing some CSS elements I found ways to make the website more presentable
- JavaScript: I learned to make my javascript more efficient by making a JS file instead of writting code in the HTML file. This saved me a lot of time.

# Challenges
- One of the hardest challenges was finding the a straight-forward way to call variables and pass events to a function through javascript without putting javascript into the HTML file.
- Another challenge fixing the mistake of writing the ID for the buttons instead of writing the variable in the JS file when giving the variable an event.

# UX/UI Design
